### [2/25/2024] Linux Software Installation Lab

#### Introduction
This lab guides participants through the process of managing software installations and removals in a Linux distribution, specifically Ubuntu, using command-line tools. By leveraging the APT package manager and sudo privileges, users install Suricata and tcpdump, essential for network security analysis.

#### Activity Overview
In this lab activity, participants will use the Advanced Package Tool (APT) and sudo to install and uninstall applications in Ubuntu. The lab emphasizes the importance of efficient software management in a Linux environment, particularly for security analysts requiring network monitoring tools like Suricata and tcpdump.

#### Scenario
Your role as a security analyst requires that you have the Suricata and tcpdump network security applications installed on your system. In this scenario, you have to install, uninstall, and reinstall these applications on your Linux Bash shell. You also need to confirm that youâ€™ve installed them correctly.

#### Tasks
1. **Ensure APT Installation**: Confirm the presence of the APT package manager in your Linux environment.
2. **Install and Uninstall Suricata**:
   - Install Suricata using the APT package manager (`sudo apt install suricata`).
   - Verify the installation by running the `suricata` command.
   - Uninstall Suricata using `sudo apt remove suricata`.
3. **Install the tcpdump Application**: Install tcpdump, a network traffic capturing tool, using the APT package manager (`sudo apt install tcpdump`).
4. **List Installed Applications**: Confirm the installation of required applications by listing all installed applications using the APT package manager (`apt list --installed`).

### [2/18/2024] NIST Cybersecurity Framework Incident Report

This folder contains documents related to network security practices and incident response strategies, focusing on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

- Explored security hardening tasks, configurations, and risk assessment in network environments.
- Addressed vulnerabilities through Multifactor Authentication, Firewall Rule Configuration, and Password Policy Enforcement.
- Included a scenario document highlighting major vulnerabilities and the necessity for security measures.

The documents available are:

- **Incident Report Analysis:** Provides a template and instructions for incident report analysis, covering sections for Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
- **Applying the NIST CSF Framework:** Offers an overview of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework's five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. It includes detailed questions and considerations for each function, aiding in managing cybersecurity risks effectively.
- **Completed Example of an Incident Report Analysis:** Includes an example incident report detailing unauthorized access and data manipulation, along with the actions taken to Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover from the security incident.
- **Scenario for NIST Cybersecurity Framework:** Presents a scenario involving a DDoS attack and the subsequent investigation and mitigation measures. It assigns tasks to a cybersecurity analyst to create a plan following the NIST CSF framework.

These documents offer valuable insights into network security practices, incident response strategies, and the application of frameworks like the NIST CSF for effectively managing cybersecurity risks.
