# Cybersecurity Incident Analysis and NIST CSF Framework Integration

Cybersecurity incident analysis and the application of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framework (CSF) to enhance network security.

## 1. Incident Report Analysis

### Summary
Our multimedia company encountered a DDoS attack, resulting in a compromised network for two hours. We mitigated the attack by blocking ICMP packets, halting non-critical network services, and restoring critical services. Investigation showed that a malicious actor initiated a flood of ICMP pings through an unconfigured firewall, causing the DDoS attack. Mitigation measures were implemented, including new firewall rules, source IP address verification, network monitoring software, and an IDS/IPS system.

### Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover
For detailed insights into how we identified, protected, detected, responded, and recovered from the incident, please refer to the [Incident Report Analysis](#1-incident-report-analysis).

## 2. Applying the NIST CSF

### Summary
The NIST CSF framework offers five core functions: identify, protect, detect, respond, and recover. Each function plays a vital role in managing cybersecurity risks and ensuring effective security strategies. Plans based on this framework should be continuously updated to stay ahead of the latest security threats.

### Core Functions
- **Identify**: Manage security risks through regular audits and identify potential gaps in security.
- **Protect**: Develop and implement safeguards to mitigate cybersecurity threats.
- **Detect**: Improve monitoring capabilities to detect security incidents efficiently.
- **Respond**: Contain, neutralize, and analyze security incidents; implement improvements to the security process.
- **Recover**: Restore affected systems and data to normal operation after an incident.

For detailed insights into applying the NIST CSF, please refer to the [NIST CSF Application](#2-applying-the-nist-csf).

## 3. Completed Example of an Incident Report Analysis

### Summary
In this example in a recent incident, unauthorized access to the network and customer database was reported. An audit was conducted, new authentication policies, and training to prevent future attacks.

### Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover
For detailed insight on the example incident report, please refer to [Completed Example](#3-completed-example-of-an-incident-report-analysis).

## 4. Scenario for NIST Cybersecurity Framework

### Summary
Our organization recently experienced a DDoS attack, compromising the internal network for two hours. The incident management team responded promptly, and our cybersecurity team investigated the event, implementing measures to enhance network security.

### Plan Implementation
- Implemented new firewall rules
- Source IP address verification on the firewall
- Network monitoring software deployment
- IDS/IPS system implementation

For detailed insights into the scenario and plan implementation, please refer to the [Scenario](#4-scenario-for-nist-cybersecurity-framework).
