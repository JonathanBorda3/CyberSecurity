# SQL Project: Investigating Security Issues

## Overview
This SQL project focuses on analyzing data to uncover potential security threats related to login attempts and employee information within an organization. By leveraging SQL filters, the project aims to identify suspicious activities, gather insights about employee behavior, and fortify security measures accordingly.

## Project Structure
The project comprises several SQL queries targeting specific aspects of security investigation:
- **Retrieve after-hours failed login attempts:** This query filters for failed login attempts that occurred after 18:00, aiding in the investigation of potential security incidents outside regular business hours.
- **Retrieve login attempts on specific dates:** By querying login attempts on specific dates, the project seeks to pinpoint suspicious activities that might be tied to specific events or incidents.
- **Retrieve login attempts outside of Mexico:** This query isolates login attempts originating from countries other than Mexico, helping identify potential external threats.
- **Retrieve employees in Marketing:** Targeting employees in the Marketing department, this query gathers information crucial for security updates and compliance within this department.
- **Retrieve employees in Finance or Sales:** This query identifies employees in the Finance or Sales departments, aiding in targeted security measures for these crucial departments.
- **Retrieve all employees not in IT:** By excluding employees from the IT department, this query focuses on identifying security needs for other departments.

## Execution
To execute these SQL queries and replicate the project's analysis, follow these steps:
1. Ensure access to the relevant database containing the log_in_attempts and employees tables.
2. Copy and paste each SQL query into your preferred SQL query editor or command line interface.
3. Execute each query to retrieve the desired data sets for further analysis.

## Results and Insights
The project's SQL queries yield valuable insights into potential security threats, employee behavior patterns, and departmental security needs. The retrieved data sets can be further analyzed and utilized to strengthen security protocols, address vulnerabilities, and ensure a robust security posture within the organization.
