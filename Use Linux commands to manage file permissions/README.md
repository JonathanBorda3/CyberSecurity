## File Permissions in Linux

### Project Description
This project involves examining and modifying file permissions on a Linux system within the /home/researcher2/projects directory, focusing on checking current permissions, interpreting permission strings, changing permissions, and ensuring proper access control according to organizational policies.

### Summary
I adjusted various permissions in the projects directory to align with organizational requirements, guided by ls -la checks and chmod commands, emphasizing security policies and access control standards within the project's directory.

# File Permissions Management

## Current & Updated File Permissions

### Current File Permissions
The Current File Permissions document displays the initial file structure and permissions of the /home/researcher2/projects directory and its contents. It provides a snapshot of the permissions assigned to each file and subdirectory, including hidden files, allowing you to understand the baseline access control settings.

### Updated File Permissions
The Updated File Permissions document reflects the changes made to file permissions during the project. It shows the updated permissions for each file and subdirectory in the /home/researcher2/projects directory after applying the necessary modifications as per organizational security policies. This document serves as a record of the adjusted access control settings, ensuring that the permissions align with the desired authorization levels.

## Scenario & Instructions for Linux Commands

In this scenario, you, a security professional at a large organization, collaborate closely with the research team. Your role involves ensuring that users within this team have the appropriate permissions, contributing to system security.

The "Instructions for Linux Commands" document in this repository serves as a comprehensive guide for managing file permissions on a Linux system, specifically within the `/home/researcher2/projects` directory. It outlines steps for checking permissions, understanding permission strings, and modifying permissions according to organizational policies. This document is crucial for executing Linux commands effectively, maintaining security standards, and managing access control within the specified directory.
