# Parking Lot USB Exercise

## Purpose
This README.md document provides an overview of the scenario involving a USB drive found in the parking lot at Rhetorical Hospital. It outlines the steps taken to inspect the contents of the USB drive, apply an attacker mindset, and analyze the associated risks. The document also includes information about the types of data found on the USB drive, potential uses of that data by attackers, and strategies to mitigate USB baiting attacks.

## Contents
The USB drive contains personal and work files of Jorge Bailey, including family photos, work documents, and sensitive information about hospital operations. Mixing personal and work data on one device poses security risks.

## Attacker Mindset
The USB drive's contents could be exploited by attackers to impersonate coworkers or access sensitive hospital information, leading to potential data breaches or targeted attacks.

## Risk Analysis
Mitigating USB-baiting attacks requires employee training, operational controls like antivirus scans, and technical measures such as endpoint security software and disabling AutoPlay on company PCs. These layers of defense reduce the risk of unauthorized access and data breaches.
