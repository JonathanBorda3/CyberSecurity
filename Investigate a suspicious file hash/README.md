# Project: Cybersecurity Incident Investigation and Analysis

## Purpose
This project focuses on a cybersecurity incident involving a suspicious file download at a financial services company. It provides a step-by-step guide for investigating the incident, using tools like SHA256 hashing and VirusTotal for IoC discovery. The goal is to analyze the file's maliciousness and understand associated indicators of compromise (IoCs) using the Pyramid of Pain framework.

## Key Points

### Scenario
The scenario involves a level one security operations center (SOC) analyst investigating a suspicious file download on an employee's computer. The file, received via email, contains a malicious payload executed after the employee entered a provided password.

### Steps for Completing the Activity
1. Review the alert details and timeline.
2. Enter the file hash into VirusTotal for IoC discovery.
3. Analyze the VirusTotal report for detections, behaviors, and IoCs.
4. Determine if the file is malicious based on report findings.
5. Enter identified IoCs into the Pyramid of Pain template.

### Incident Handler's Journal
The incident handler's journal captures details of the incident, including who, what, when, where, and why, along with additional notes about the file's malicious nature and associated threat actors.

### Explanation if File is Malicious
The Pyramid of Pain  document/PowerPoint includes an explanation of why the file is identified as malicious based on security vendor detections, community scores, and malware analysis findings.

### Pyramid of Pain
The Pyramid of Pain template is filled out with identified tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), tools, network/host artifacts, domain names, IP addresses, and hash values associated with the malicious file.

## Conclusion
Through this project, I demonstrate a structured approach to cybersecurity incident investigation and analysis. By leveraging tools like SHA256 hashing and VirusTotal, along with frameworks like the Pyramid of Pain, we can effectively identify, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity threats in a systematic manner.
