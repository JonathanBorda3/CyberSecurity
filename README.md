# Cybersecurity Practice Work

This branch is dedicated to my CyberSecurity profile on GitHub. Here, I'll be documenting my progress, security audits, and practice work related to cybersecurity.

## Updates
### [3/13/2024] NIST Cybersecurity Framework Incident Report

This folder contains documents related to network security practices and incident response strategies, focusing on the NIST Cybersecurity Framework (CSF).

- Explored security hardening tasks, configurations, and risk assessment in network environments.
- Addressed vulnerabilities through Multifactor Authentication, Firewall Rule Configuration, and Password Policy Enforcement.
- Included a scenario document highlighting major vulnerabilities and the necessity for security measures.

The documents available are:

- **Incident Report Analysis:** Provides a template and instructions for incident report analysis, covering sections for Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover.
- **Applying the NIST CSF Framework:** Offers an overview of the NIST Cybersecurity Framework's five core functions: Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover. It includes detailed questions and considerations for each function, aiding in managing cybersecurity risks effectively.
- **Completed Example of an Incident Report Analysis:** Includes an example incident report detailing unauthorized access and data manipulation, along with the actions taken to Identify, Protect, Detect, Respond, and Recover from the security incident.
- **Scenario for NIST Cybersecurity Framework:** Presents a scenario involving a DDoS attack and the subsequent investigation and mitigation measures. It assigns tasks to a cybersecurity analyst to create a plan following the NIST CSF framework.

These documents offer valuable insights into network security practices, incident response strategies, and the application of frameworks like the NIST CSF for effectively managing cybersecurity risks.
