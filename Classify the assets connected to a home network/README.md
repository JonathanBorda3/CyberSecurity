# Home Network Device Inventory

## Overview

This file contains an Excel sheet and related documentation for creating an inventory of network devices in a small home business environment. The goal is to identify sensitive information, assess security levels, and implement appropriate protection measures.

## Scenario

Operating a small business from home requires understanding and documenting network devices. This includes desktops, smartphones, smart home devices, game consoles, storage devices, and more.

## Steps

1. **Identify Assets**: Choose three devices not listed in the Excel sheet and add them along with their characteristics.
2. **Fill in Characteristics**: List important details like network access, owner, and location for each asset.
3. **Evaluate Access**: Assess the sensitivity of devices based on stored information, network connection, and owner's security practices.
4. **Classify Sensitivity**: Assign sensitivity levels (e.g., Restricted, Internal-only, Confidential) based on potential impact on the business if compromised.

## Excel Sheet Overview

The Excel sheet includes columns for Asset, Network access, Owner, Location, Notes, and Sensitivity. Use the provided categories and access designations to classify devices accordingly.
